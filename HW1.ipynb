        "## How to Use Jupyter Notebooks for Our Assignment\n",
        "Throughout our first assignment, we'll utilize Jupyter Notebooks to walk you through concepts, let you implement them, and also allow you to experiment on your own. By the end of this assignment, you'll not only understand word embeddings more deeply but will also become familiar with a powerful tool used extensively in the data science community.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Cells:\n",
        "**Markdown Cells**: These cells (like the one you're reading now) are utilized to write text, frame explanations, embed images, or even formulate equations. They make our notebook more explanatory and structured.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Code Cells**: This is where the action happens. In these cells, you'll write and execute Python code. They will play a critical role in our exercises as you experiment with word embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Warning*: Refrain from rearranging, adding, or deleting any cells. Ensure that you only modify the code cells that begin with '# Your code here'. Alterations outside of these designated areas might lead to grading malfunctions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Runtime Volatility\n",
        "As you navigate and execute the cells within this Jupyter notebook, it's crucial to understand that the runtime environment is volatile. In simpler terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   If you restart the notebook or experience a disconnection, all your in-memory data and variables will be lost.\n",
        "*   While the code and markdown cells will remain, the outputs from code cells will need to be regenerated by rerunning them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, if you're working on a task over an extended period or with large datasets, remember to save your results and progress frequently to avoid potential data loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Running this Notebook on Google Colab\n",
        "Google Colab is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. To run this notebook on Colab:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Save a copy of this notebook on your **Google Drive**.\n",
        "2.   Open the notebook in Google Colab.\n",
        "3.   In Google Colab, you can execute each cell using the play button (or use the keyboard shortcuts mentioned above).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tip**: Google Colab may automatically disconnect after a certain period of inactivity. Keep this in mind, especially when running longer tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: Google Colab provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, which might be useful for later assignments."

        "## What are Word Embeddings?\n",
        "At a high level, word embeddings are a type of word representation that captures semantic meanings of words based on their context. These representations are vectors, where words with similar meanings are located close to each other in a large dimensional vector space.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, the word \"dog\" in a word embedding space will be closer to \"puppy\" than to \"car\". These embeddings are incredibly powerful as they capture various semantic relationships, from synonyms and antonyms to analogies."

        "PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a technique used for dimensionality reduction. In simpler terms, it's a method to simplify the complexity in high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns. It does this by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables, the principal components, which are orthogonal (perpendicular), and which reflect the maximum variance in the data.\n",

        "In the context of visualizing word embeddings, PCA will help us reduce the high-dimensional word vectors (e.g., 300 dimensions for the Google News vectors) into 2D, which can be easily plotted and visualized."
